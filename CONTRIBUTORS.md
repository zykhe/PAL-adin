# Contributors

Thank you to all the people who have contributed to PAL-adin! üü£

## Recognition Philosophy

PAL-adin follows UNOWN principles of zero-hierarchy and anonymous contribution. Contributors are recognized for their work, but all have equal decision-making power regardless of contribution count or visibility level.

## Contribution Levels

### Visibility Levels
Contributors can choose their preferred level of visibility:
- **Anonymous**: No identity disclosure
- **Pseudonymous**: Consistent pseudonym
- **Semi-Public**: Partial identity (e.g., first name, region)
- **Fully Public**: Full identity disclosure

**Note**: All visibility levels have equal rights and decision-making power.
