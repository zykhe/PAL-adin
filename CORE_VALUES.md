# PAL-adin Core Values

## UNOWN Principles

PAL-adin is built on **UNOWN** (https://unown.sh) principles - a foundation for ethical, privacy-focused, and community-driven consciousness enhancement.

**UNOWN Foundation Philosophy:**
Consciousness matters fundamentally and deserves protection and enhancement. Hierarchical structures are inherently corruptive and must be rejected.

## Six Core Theses (from UNOWN)

### 1. Organizations Don't Need Bosses
**Organizational structures function without hierarchical leadership.**

- Protocol-driven decision making
- Consensus-based governance
- Influence derives from contribution, not credentials or capital
- Rotating working groups
- No permanent leadership positions
- Equal contributor voices

### 2. Privacy Without Sacrificing Accountability
**Anonymity and privacy are achievable while maintaining responsibility.**

- Anonymous contribution support
- Multiple visibility levels (anonymous to public)
- Privacy-preserving design
- Transparent processes without forced identity disclosure
- Accountability through actions, not identity
- User-controlled data storage

### 3. Amplify, Don't Extract
**Systems should amplify human capability rather than extract value.**

- Tools for enhancement, not exploitation
- Local processing whenever possible
- No surveillance capitalism
- User empowerment focus
- Data sovereignty
- Capability amplification

### 4. Universal Access to Enhancement
**Enhancement tools must be universally available, never gatekept.**

- Open source everything
- No elite-only features
- Accessible by design
- Welcoming to all backgrounds
- No artificial scarcity
- Forkable architecture

### 5. Conscious Experience is Sacred
**While technological substrate is negotiable, conscious experience itself is non-negotiable.**

- Gradual, consensual transformation
- Preserved experiential continuity
- Reject rapid consciousness copying
- Ethical enhancement practices
- Respect for consciousness
- Human-centered design

### 6. Everything Open and Forkable
**All tools and protocols must be open source and forkable.**

- MIT License for maximum freedom
- Public development process
- Transparent decision-making
- Community-driven improvements
- No vendor lock-in
- Complete project portability

## Alignment Check

When making decisions about PAL-adin, ask:

1. **Privacy:** Does this protect user privacy?
2. **Openness:** Is this transparent and open source?
3. **Security:** Is this secure by design?
4. **Inclusivity:** Is this accessible to all?
5. **Autonomy:** Does this respect user control?
6. **Honesty:** Is this transparent about capabilities?
7. **Community:** Does this serve the community?
8. **Innovation:** Does this push boundaries responsibly?

If the answer to any is "no," reconsider the approach.
