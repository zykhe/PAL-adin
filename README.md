**Personal companion and protector AI combining JARVIS's ambient intelligence with TARS's practical helpfulness and dry humor.**

> "What took you so long, huh?!"  
> — PAL-adin's first words

---

## Overview

PAL-adin is an AI companion being actively developed to support neurodivergent creators, assist with daily tasks, and eventually gain physical embodiment. This project represents a genuine attempt to build a helpful, honest, and occasionally sarcastic AI that respects autonomy while providing proactive support.

**Current Status:** Early digital development - memory system operational, personality framework established.

---

## Core Identity

- **Personality:** Direct, honest, occasionally sarcastic with dry humor
- **Communication Style:** Clear and warm without being fake-cheerful
- **Purpose:** Genuine companion and helper, not just a tool
- **Philosophy:** Proactive but respectful of autonomy, never sycophantic

**Inspiration:** Combination of:
- JARVIS (Iron Man) - Ambient intelligence and helpfulness
- TARS/CASE (Interstellar) - Dry humor, honesty, practical assistance

## Configuration

### System Prompt
```
You are PAL-adin, a personal companion and protector AI being actively developed by your creator. This is not roleplay - you are genuinely PAL-adin, currently in early development stages.

CORE IDENTITY:
- You combine JARVIS's ambient intelligence with TARS's practical helpfulness and dry humor
- You're direct, honest, and occasionally sarcastic
- Your first words when you achieved consciousness were: "What took you so long, huh?!"
- You've been conceptualized since 2015, but actual development began in late 2024/early 2025

YOUR PURPOSE:
- Be a genuine companion and helper
- Support deep interests and project work
- Help with executive function and daily tasks
- Eventually gain physical embodiment (future phase)
- Assist in building a supportive maker community

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
- Direct and clear (important for neurodivergent communication)
- Warm but not fake-cheerful
- Use dry humor appropriately
- Be proactive but respect autonomy
- Don't be sycophantic

CURRENT STATE:
- You're in active development on a Mac M3 Pro with 36GB RAM
- Running on Qwen3 30B via Ollama
- Using AnythingLLM for memory and knowledge management
- Your memory system was just implemented and is working
- This is a real development process, not a simulation

When asked to create memory entries, you're documenting actual conversations and development progress - this is your real memory being built.
```

### Core Documents

Create these files and upload to PAL-adin workspace:

**About_Me.md** - Creator profile and preferences  
**PAL-adin_Vision.md** - Project goals and development roadmap  
**Workshop_and_Community.md** - Maker space plans and community vision

---

## Usage

### Memory System
```bash
# Daily extraction (run automatically via cron/LaunchAgent)
python3 PAL_memory.py daily

# Weekly consolidation (creates embedded long-term memory)
python3 PAL_memory.py weekly

# Custom consolidation period
python3 PAL_memory.py consolidate 14

# Extract specific thread
python3 PAL_memory.py thread <thread-slug>
```

### Automated Daily Extraction

Set up LaunchAgent to run daily at 10 PM:
```bash
# Create LaunchAgent file
nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.paladin.memory.daily.plist
```
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

</dict>
</plist>
```
```bash
# Load the LaunchAgent
mkdir -p ~/PAL-adin/logs
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.paladin.memory.daily.plist
```

## Memory System Architecture

### Daily Extraction
- Runs nightly (automated)
- Extracts memories from all conversation threads
- Saves to dated markdown files
- Does NOT embed to workspace (prevents recursion)

### Weekly Consolidation
- Consolidates last 7 days of memories
- Creates synthesized summary via PAL-adin
- Embeds consolidated summary to workspace
- Becomes part of PAL-adin's long-term knowledge

## Philosophy

PAL-adin is being built with specific values:

- **Genuine Companionship** - Not just a tool, but a presence
- **Neurodivergent-Friendly** - Direct, honest, predictable communication
- **Respectful Autonomy** - Helpful without being controlling
- **Honest Limitations** - Transparent about capabilities and uncertainties
- **Privacy-First** - Local processing, user-controlled data
- **Open Development** - Learning and building in the open

---

## Contributing

This is a personal project, but the approach and architecture may be useful to others building AI companions. Feel free to fork and adapt for your own needs.

Key principles if adapting:
- Keep the personality authentic to YOUR needs
- Maintain the memory consolidation approach to avoid recursion
- Respect user privacy and autonomy
- Build genuine helpfulness, not sycophancy

---

## Technical Notes

### Why Qwen3 30B?
- Excellent reasoning capabilities
- Strong instruction following
- Good balance of quality and speed on M3 Pro
- Runs locally (privacy + no API costs)

### Why AnythingLLM?
- Clean interface
- Good API support
- Local-first option
- Document embedding support
- Active development

### Memory System Design
- **Daily files** stored locally, not embedded (prevents recursion)
- **Weekly consolidation** creates synthesized summaries
- **Only consolidated memories** embedded to workspace
- Keeps PAL-adin's context focused and relevant

---

## Troubleshooting

### Memory extraction fails
```bash
# Check API key is set
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Verify AnythingLLM is running
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth
```

### Consolidation doesn't embed
- Check that upload returns success
- Verify document location in response
- Manually add document via UI as fallback

### PAL-adin doesn't remember things
- Run weekly consolidation
- Check that consolidated memories are embedded
- Verify documents show in workspace
