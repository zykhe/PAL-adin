# PAL-adin Project Governance

## Overview

PAL-adin is an open-source project under the UNOWN initiative, governed by protocol-based consensus that ensures transparency, inclusivity, and technical excellence. This document outlines the governance protocols, decision-making processes, and community guidelines.

## Mission Statement

To create a secure, privacy-focused AI assistant that evolves from a helpful companion to a true digital friend, while maintaining open-source principles and community ownership under UNOWN's zero-hierarchy framework.

## Core Values

- **Privacy First**: User data protection and encryption are non-negotiable
- **Open Source**: All code and documentation should be freely available
- **Zero Hierarchy**: No leaders, founders, or permanent authority roles
- **Protocol-Driven**: Decisions made through documented consensus protocols
- **Security Focused**: Security is a primary consideration in all decisions
- **Inclusive**: Welcome contributors from all backgrounds and experience levels
- **Anonymous Contribution**: Contributors can participate at any visibility level
- **Innovative**: Push the boundaries of AI assistant technology

## Governance Structure

### Zero-Hierarchy Protocol-Based Governance

PAL-adin operates without formal leadership roles, titles, or permanent authority positions. Instead, we use documented protocols and consensus mechanisms for decision-making.

### Visibility Levels for Contributors

Contributors can participate at any level of visibility they choose:

- **Anonymous**: No identity disclosure, contributions via secure channels
- **Pseudonymous**: Consistent pseudonym without real identity
- **Semi-Public**: Partial identity disclosure (e.g., first name, region)
- **Fully Public**: Full identity disclosure

**All visibility levels have equal decision-making power based on contribution quality, not identity.**

### Working Groups (Temporary, Rotating)

Working groups are temporary, self-organizing teams focused on specific domains. Participation is voluntary and rotates naturally based on availability and interest.

#### Security Working Group
- **Focus**: Security policies, vulnerability management, security audits
- **Coordination**: Asynchronous via secure channels
- **Decision Process**: Consensus protocol (detailed below)
- **Participation**: Open to all contributors, no approval needed

#### Documentation Working Group
- **Focus**: Documentation standards, user guides, API documentation
- **Coordination**: Asynchronous collaboration
- **Decision Process**: Consensus protocol
- **Participation**: Open to all contributors, no approval needed

#### Development Working Group
- **Focus**: Code architecture, features, technical implementation
- **Coordination**: GitHub discussions and PRs
- **Decision Process**: Consensus protocol
- **Participation**: Open to all contributors, no approval needed

## Decision Making Process

### Protocol-Based Consensus (No Voting Hierarchy)

All decisions use time-boxed consensus protocols. There are no voting hierarchies - all contributors have equal voice based on their engagement with the specific issue, not their status or contribution count.

### Types of Decisions

#### Minor Decisions (72-Hour Feedback Protocol)
- **Scope**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor improvements, dependency patches
- **Process**:
  1. Proposal posted publicly (GitHub issue/discussion)
  2. 72-hour feedback period
  3. If no objections with technical merit, proceed
  4. If objections raised, move to Standard Decision protocol
- **Implementation**: Proposer can implement after feedback period

#### Standard Decisions (2-Week Deliberation Protocol)
- **Scope**: New features, architecture changes, significant refactoring, API changes
- **Process**:
  1. Detailed proposal with rationale and implementation plan
  2. 2-week public discussion period
  3. Address concerns and iterate on proposal
  4. Achieve rough consensus (general agreement, objections addressed)
  5. If consensus not reached, extend discussion or seek alternative approaches
- **Consensus Threshold**: No strong objections remaining after discussion

#### Major Decisions (30-Day Community Protocol)
- **Scope**: Major architectural changes, governance protocol changes, security model changes
- **Process**:
  1. Comprehensive proposal with multiple alternatives analyzed
  2. 30-day public discussion period
  3. Multiple rounds of feedback and iteration
  4. External expert review (if applicable)
  5. Achieve broad consensus across working groups
  6. Document dissenting views and how they were addressed
- **Consensus Threshold**: Broad agreement with documented consideration of all perspectives

#### Critical Security Decisions (Rapid Response Protocol)
- **Scope**: Security vulnerabilities, immediate threats, privacy breaches
- **Process**:
  1. Private disclosure to Security Working Group
  2. Rapid assessment (4-24 hours)
  3. Immediate action if critical
  4. Community notification after fix deployed
  5. Post-incident public review
- **Authority**: Any contributor can trigger security protocol

### Consensus Criteria

A proposal has reached consensus when:
1. **Adequate deliberation time** has passed for the decision type
2. **Active objections addressed**: All technical objections have been discussed and either resolved or documented with rationale for proceeding
3. **No blocking concerns**: No unresolved concerns that would break core principles (privacy, security, zero-hierarchy, open source)
4. **Rough agreement**: General agreement among engaged contributors, even if not unanimous

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

#### Stage 1: Direct Discussion (0-7 days)
- Conflicting parties discuss directly in public forum
- Focus on technical merits and UNOWN principles
- Any contributor can participate in discussion
- No mediators or authorities

#### Stage 2: Extended Deliberation (7-21 days)
- If Stage 1 doesn't resolve, extend discussion period
- Invite broader community input
- Explore alternative solutions
- Document all perspectives

#### Stage 3: Protocol Clarification (21+ days)
- If still unresolved, recognize that current protocols may be unclear
- Initiate governance protocol improvement discussion
- Defer original decision until protocol is clarified
- Focus on improving decision-making process itself

## Contribution Guidelines

### Contribution Recognition (Not Hierarchy)

All contributors have equal decision-making power regardless of contribution count. Recognition is about celebrating contributions, not creating privilege levels.
